This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Document how to write extensions
- Encourage people to translate the administration interface
- Finish frontend editing -- not much more than a proof of concept now
- Document template tags
- ajax_editable_boolean functionality is very non-obvious to the admin
  interface user
- the tree editor drag/drop icons seem to be unclear
- Some PageManager methods crash when there are two active objects with the same _cached_url

Infanta - A FeinCMS extension to manage contents of reusabble apps
------------------------------------------------------------------

- think about a way of making it easier to integrate reusable app
- maybe add a mapper, which converts a BlockNode with the according block name to a BoxNode assigend by the mapper
- attach a view content which is not defined in the page tree at the end of the region
- decide what to do if a region defined in the templatetag is not found
  for example a extrajs block, which should be rendered in the <head> tag
